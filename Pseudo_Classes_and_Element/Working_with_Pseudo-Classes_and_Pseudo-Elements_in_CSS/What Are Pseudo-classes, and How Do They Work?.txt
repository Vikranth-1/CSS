Pseudo-classes are special CSS keywords that allow you to select an element based on its specific state or position. The element's state or position could include:

When it's active.
When it's being hovered over by a mouse.
When it's the first child of a parent.
When it's the last child of a parent.
When a link has been visited.
When it's disabled.
To use a pseudo-class, you add it to the selector by using a colon (:) followed by the name of the pseudo-class:

selector:pseudo-class {
  /* CSS properties */
}
Let's see how you can use a pseudo-class to represent each of the states and positions we already mentioned.

The :active pseudo-class lets you select the active state of an element, like clicking on a button:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<button>Example Button</button>
button:active {
  background: greenyellow;
}
The :hover pseudo-class defines the hover state of an element. An example would be hovering over a button or link:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<a href="#">Hover over me!</a>  
a:hover {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: white;
  background: crimson;
}
The :first-child pseudo-class selects an element that is the first child of its parent element. Here's an example of targeting the first paragraph element in a div container:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<div class="container">
  <p>first child</p>
  <p>second child</p>
  <p>third child</p>
  <p>last child</p>
</div>
.container p:first-child {
  background: lightcoral;
  padding: 0.4rem;
}
The first paragraph element in that div will receive the lightcoral background color and padding of 0.4rem on all four sides.

The :last-child pseudo-class targets the last element that is the child of its parent. Here is an example of targeting the last paragraph element in the container div element:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<div class="container">
  <p>first child</p>
  <p>second child</p>
  <p>third child</p>
  <p>last child</p>
</div>
.container p:last-child {
  background: lightcoral;
  padding: 0.4rem;
}
The :visited pseudo-class lets you style a link the user has already visited:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example.com</a>
a:visited {
  color: purple;
}
The :disabled pseudo-class lets you style an interactive element in disabled mode:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<button disabled>Disabled Button</button>
button:disabled {
  background-color: lightgray;  
}
As you can see, pseudo-classes let you style elements based on user interactions, like hovering or visiting a link. This makes your website feel more interactive.

Apart from the pseudo-classes already mentioned, there are others like:

:focus
:first-of-type
:last-of-type
:nth-of-type
:modal
:enabled
:checked
:required, and more.
