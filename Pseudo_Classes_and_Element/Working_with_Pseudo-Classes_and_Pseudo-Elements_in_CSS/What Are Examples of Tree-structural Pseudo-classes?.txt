Tree-structural pseudo-classes allow you to target and style elements based on their position within the document tree. The document tree refers to the hierarchical structure of elements in an HTML document.

Here is a list of tree-structural pseudo-classes:

:root
:empty
:nth-child(n)
:nth-last-child(n)
:first-child
:last-child
:only-child
:nth-of-type
:first-of-type
:last-of-type
:only-of-type
Let's take a closer look at each of the tree-structural pseudo-classes, accompanied by examples.

​​The :root pseudo-class is usually the root html element. It helps you target the highest level in the document so you can apply a common style to the entire document.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This is a sample paragraph to demonstrate the :root pseudo-class.</p>
:root {
  background: black;
  color: aliceblue;
}
The :root pseudo-class is also commonly used in setting CSS variables:

:root {
  --main-font: 'Arial, sans-serif';
  --primary-color: blue; 
  --secondary-color: green; 
}
With CSS variables, you get to store values and reuse them in your stylesheet. You will learn more about these later on.

Empty elements, that is, elements with no children other than white space, are also included in the document tree. That's why there's an :empty pseudo-class to target empty elements. For example, this HTML code has two empty list items. With the :empty pseudo-class, you can style the empty list items differently:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li></li> <!-- This list is empty -->
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li></li> <!-- Another empty list -->
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
:empty {
  background: black;
}
The most practical thing to do with the empty list items is probably not displaying them at all:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li></li> <!-- This list is empty -->
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li></li> <!-- Another empty list -->
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
:empty {
  display: none;
}
:nth-child(n) allows you to select elements based on their position within a parent, while :nth-last-child(n) enables you to select elements by counting from the end. The n can be a specific number or a keyword like odd or even. This is incredibly useful in styling table cells based on position: even and odd.

Here's an HTML example of a fruit price list table. The CSS is using the :nth-child pseudo-class to target the table cells based on odd and even positions:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Apple</td>
    <td>$1.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Banana</td>
    <td>$0.50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Orange</td>
    <td>$0.80</td>
  </tr>
</table>
th,
td {
  border: 1px solid lightgray;
  padding: 8px;
}

tr:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: orangered;
}

tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
The :first-child, :last-child, and :only-child pseudo-classes all act on items within a parent container or the entire document.

:first-child selects the first element in a parent element or the document.
:last-child selects the last element in a parent element or the document.
:only-child selects the only element in a parent element or the document.
Using the :first-child and :last-child pseudo-classes will select both Item 1 and Item 3 in this example:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
li:first-child {
  background-color: orangered;
}

li:last-child {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
If you have more unordered lists on the page, you have to be more specific with the selection:

To show you how the :only-child pseudo-class works, here's an HTML example with two separate div elements. Using the :only-child pseudo-class ensures only the div element with a single child is selected:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
<div class="container">
  <div>This is the only item in this container.</div>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <div>This is one of two items in this container.</div>
  <div>Here is the second item.</div>
</div>
.container div:only-child {
  border: 2px solid crimson;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
The :first-of-type and :last-of-type pseudo-classes select the first and last occurrence of a specific element type within its parent. They are useful for applying unique styles to the first or last instance of that element type among its siblings.

In the example below, :first-of-type and :last-of-type applies to the first element and last element within the section element:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This is the first paragraph in the first section</p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph in the first section</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Details</h2>
  <p>This is the first paragraph in the second section.</p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph in the second section.</p>
</section>
section p:first-of-type {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

section p:last-of-type {
  background-color:lightblue;
}
:nth-of-type(n) allows you to select a specific element within its parent based on its position among siblings of the same type. For instance, in the HTML below, :nth-of-type(2) targets the second element in the container:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

<div class="container">
  <p>First paragraph</p>
  <p>Second paragraph</p>
  <p>Third paragraph</p>
</div>
p:nth-of-type(2) {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
:only-of-type selects an element if it's the only one of its type within its parent. This can be useful for emphasizing single items or ensuring that they are styled differently when they’re not part of a group.

In the example below, there are two div elements with one having a single element. The CSS only applies to the first container:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

<div class="container">
  <p>The only paragraph</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>The first paragraph</p>
  <p>The second paragraph</p>
</div>
p:only-of-type {
  border: 4px solid green;
}
