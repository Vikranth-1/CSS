When working with background images in CSS, you have several properties at your disposal to control how these images are displayed.

The main properties we'll focus on are background-size, background-repeat, background-position, and background-attachment.

Let’s first take a look at the background-image property:

<style>
  body {
    background-image: url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
  }
</style>
The above CSS sets a cat background image for the body element.

If you want to set the size for the background image, you can use the background-size property.

You can use contain to scale the image as large as possible without cropping or stretching.

Here's an example with background-size: contain:

<style>
  body {
    background-image: url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
    background-size: contain;
    min-height: 100px;
  }
</style>
We are setting the min-height to 100px so the background image is visible and the layout maintains a baseline height, ensuring that even with minimal content, the design appears balanced and visually appealing.

If we change the background-size property to use the cover value, then the background image will scale to cover the entire body element while maintaining its aspect ratio.

<style>
  body {
    background-image: url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    min-height: 100px;
  }
</style>
In the previous examples, you probably noticed that the background image would continuously repeat.

By default, background images repeat both horizontally and vertically to fill the entire element. However, you can control this behavior.

You can use the background-repeat property with the value set to no-repeat.

<style>
  body {
    background-image: url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    min-height: 100px;
  }
</style>
With the background-size set to contain and the background-repeat set to no-repeat, the image will no longer repeat on the screen.

If you wanted to repeat the background image horizontally, you can use the repeat-x value for the background-repeat property.

<style>
  body {
    background-image: url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
    min-height: 100px;
  }
</style>
If you wanted to repeat the background image vertically, you can use the repeat-y value for the background-repeat property.

<style>
  body {
    background-image: url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: repeat-y;
    min-height: 100px;
  }
</style>
To position a background image on the screen, you can use the background-position property.

The background-position property allows you to set where in the element the background image appears. You can use keywords like top, bottom, left, right, and center, or specific pixel or percentage values.

Here is an example using the center and top for the background-position:

<style>
  body {
    background-image: url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center top;
    min-height: 100px;
  }
</style>
This CSS code positions the background image at the center of the element horizontally and at the top vertically.

Lastly, background-attachment determines whether the background image scrolls with the content or remains fixed when the page is scrolled.

The main values are scroll (default), where the background image scrolls with the content, and fixed, where the background image stays in the same position on the screen.

Here is an example using the fixed value for the background-attachment property:

<style>
  body {
    background-image: url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
    background-position: center top;
    background-attachment: fixed;
  }
</style>
This CSS code sets the background image to remain fixed in place even when the page is scrolled.

If you wanted to combine a few of the properties into one line, you can do that by using the shorthand background property.

Here is an example:

<style>
  body {
    background: center top fixed
      url("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg");
  }
</style>
The above example combines the background-image, background-position, and background-attachment into a single line.

By mastering these properties, you'll have great control over how background images are displayed in your web designs, allowing for more visually appealing and functional layouts.
