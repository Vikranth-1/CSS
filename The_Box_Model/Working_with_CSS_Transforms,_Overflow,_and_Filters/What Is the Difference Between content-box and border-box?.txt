The box-sizing property can be set to either content-box or border-box to control how the width and height of elements are calculated.

This property can be set on the universal selector (*) to apply to all the elements in the document:

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
The value of the box-sizing property is content-box by default, but you can choose border-box if you need to. We will explore content-box first and then we will go into border-box.

To understand how the models work, you need to be familiar with the four core concepts from the CSS box model. Let's review them quickly.

The content area is the space occupied by the element's content.
The padding is the space between the content area and the border.
The border is the outline that surrounds the content area and the padding.
The margin is the space outside the border that separates the element from other elements.
In the content-box model, the width and height that you set for an element determine the dimensions of the content area, but they don't include the padding, border, or margin. Use content-box when you need precise control over the content area. When you set width and height, you're only setting the size of the content itself.

To find the total width of the element, you will need to add the left and right padding, and the left and right borders. Likewise, the total height of an element can be found by adding the content height, the top and bottom padding, and the top and bottom borders.

For example, here we have a CSS type selector for all the div elements.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<div></div>
div {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 4px solid black;
}
In this case, if content-box is used the content area will be 300px by 200px. The total rendered size includes padding and borders — for example, total width = 300px (content) + 40px (padding) + 8px (borders) = 348px; the total height is calculated in the same way.

Great! Now let's explore border-box. It's different because the width and height you set include the element's content, padding, and border (but not its margin). Use border-box when you want the element's total size to stay fixed even if padding or borders change — that's often helpful in responsive layouts.

With border-box, padding and borders are included inside the element's specified size. The width and height you set become the element's total dimensions: content + padding + border; margins remain excluded.

In the following example, there are two div elements with the same dimensions but different box-sizing values. Notice how this results in different total sizes when viewed in the browser:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<div class="box" id="red-div"></div>
<div class="box" id="blue-div"></div>
.box {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 4px solid black;
  margin: 10px;
}

#red-div {
  box-sizing: content-box;
  background-color: red;
}

#blue-div {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  background-color: blue;
}
You can see that they both have the same width, height, padding, border and margin. The only differences are in the colors and the value of the box-sizing property. This small difference has a very important impact on the final dimensions.

Choosing between content-box and border-box really depends on the specific needs of your project. While border-box is becoming increasingly popular for its simplicity and flexibility, understanding both models is important for implementing effective CSS layouts.
